# HealthCalculator
Project for national IT competition of Bulgaria 2018

This project is a part of my intiative to make people's life easier. Do not be too judgemental at evaluating this tool effectiveness. It will just demostrate what could anyone do to further advance his/hers way of living. With that beeing said I present you a PHP project written on the latest version PHP 7.2. This web site lets you insert your height and according to your gender it calculates your ideal weight. If you have to increase your weight then it will advise you to eat caloric food but if you have to decrease your weight then it would suggest to do certain exercises.

I am utilizing Pixabay Developer API, FusionCharts and a MariaDB database.
